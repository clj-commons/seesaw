(defmacro defapplet
  "Define an applet. This macro does all the gen-class business and takes maps
  applet lifetime methods to callback functions automatically. Supports the
  following options:

    :name    The name of the generated class. Defaults to the current namespace.

    :init    Function called when the applet is first loaded. Takes a single
             JApplet argument. This function is called from the UI thread.

    :start   Function called when the applet is started. Takes a single JApplet
             argument. This function is called from the UI thread.

    :stop    Function called when the applet is stopped. Takes a single JApplet
             argument. This function is called from the UI thread.

    :content Function called after :init which should return the content of
             the applet, for example some kind of panel. It's added to the center
             of a border pane so it will be resized with the applet.

  Note that the namespace containing a call to (defapplet) must be compiled. In
  Leiningen, this is easiest to do by adding an :aot option to project.clj:

    :aot [namespace.with.defapplet]

  After that, use \"lein uberjar\" to build a jar with everything.

  Since Seesaw is currently reflection heavy, the resulting jar must be signed:

    $ keytool -genkey -alias seesaw -dname \"cn=company, c=en\"
    $ keytool -selfcert -alias seesaw -dname \"cn=company, c=en\"
    $ lein uberjar
    $ jarsigner name-of-project-X.X.X-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar seesaw

  Then refer to it from your webpage like this:

    <applet archive=\"name-of-project-X.X.X-standalone.jar\"
            code=\"namespace/with/defapplet.class\"
            width=\"200\"
            height=\"200\">
