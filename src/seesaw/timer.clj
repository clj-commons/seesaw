(defn timer
  "Creates a new Swing timer that periodically executes the single-argument
  function f. The argument is a \"state\" of the timer. Each time the function
  is called its previous return value is passed to it. Kind of like (reduce)
  but spread out over time :) The following options are supported:

    :initial-value The first value passed to the handler function. Defaults to nil.
    :initial-delay Delay, in milliseconds, of first call. Defaults to 0.
    :delay         Delay, in milliseconds, between calls. Defaults to 1000.
    :repeats?      If true, the timer runs forever, otherwise, it's a
                  \"one-shot\" timer. Defaults to true.
    :start?        Whether to start the timer immediately. Defaults to true.
