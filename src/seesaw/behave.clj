(defn when-focused-select-all
  "A helper function which adds a \"select all when focus gained\" behavior to one
  or more text widgets or editable comboboxes.

  Like (seesaw.core/listen) returns a function which will remove all event handlers
  when called.

  Examples:

    (flow-panel :items [
      \"Enter some text here: \"
      (doto
         (text \"All this text will be selected when I get keyboard focus\")

(defn when-mouse-dragged
  "A helper for handling mouse dragging on a widget. This isn't that complicated,
  but the default mouse dragged event provided with Swing doesn't give the delta
  since the last drag event so you end up having to keep track of it. This function
  takes three options:

    :start event handler called when the drag is started (mouse pressed).
    :drag  A function that takes a mouse event and a [dx dy] vector which is
           the change in x and y since the last drag event.
    :finish event handler called when the drag is finished (mouse released).

  Like (seesaw.core/listen) returns a function which will remove all event handlers
  when called.

  Examples:
    See (seesaw.examples.xyz-panel)
