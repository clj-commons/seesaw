(defn empty-border
  "Create an empty border. The following properties are supported:

    :thickness The thickness of the border (all sides) in pixels. This property
               is only used if :top, :bottom, etc are omitted. Defaults to 1.

    :top       Thickness of the top border in pixels. Defaults to 0.
    :left      Thickness of the left border in pixels. Defaluts to 0.
    :bottom    Thickness of the bottom border in pixels. Defaluts to 0.
    :right     Thickness of the right border in pixels. Defaluts to 0.

  Examples:

      ; Create an empty 10 pixel border
      (empty-border :thickness 10)

      ; Create an empty border 5 pixels on top and left, 0 on other sides
      (empty-border :left 5 :top 5)

  "Create a colored border with following properties:

    :color The color, passed through (seesaw.color/to-color). Defaults to black.

  "Create a compount border from the given arguments. Order is from inner to outer.

  Examples:

  "Define a custom border with the following properties:

    :paint A function that takes the same arguments as Border.paintBorder:
             java.awt.Component c - The target component
              java.awt.Graphics g - The graphics context to draw to

                            int h - height of border

    :insets Returns the insets of the border. Can be a zero-arg function that
              returns something that is passed through (seesaw.util/to-insets)
              or a constant value passed through the same. Defaults to 0.

    :opaque? Whether the border is opaque. A constant truthy value or a zero-arg
             function that returns a truthy value.

(defn to-border
  "Construct a border. The border returned depends on the input:

    nil - returns nil
    a Border - returns b
    a number - returns an empty border with the given thickness
    a vector or list - returns a compound border by applying to-border
                       to each element, inner to outer.
    a i18n keyword   - returns a titled border using the given resource
    a string         - returns a titled border using the given stirng

  If given more than one argument, a compound border is created by applying
  to-border to each argument, inner to outer.


  Note:

  to-border is used implicitly by the :border option supported by all widgets
  to it is rarely necessary to call directly.
