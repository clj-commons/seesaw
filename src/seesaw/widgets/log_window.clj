  The returned widget implements the LogWindow protocol with
  which you can clear it, or append messages. It is thread-safe,
  i.e. messages logged from multiple threads won't be interleaved.

  It must be wrapped in (seesaw.core/scrollable) for scrolling.

  Includes a context menu with options for clearing the window
  and scroll lock.

  Returns a sub-class of javax.swing.JTextArea so any of the options
  that apply to multi-line (seesaw.core/text) apply. Also supports
  the following additional options:

    :limit Maximum number of chars to keep in the log. When this limit
           is reached, chars will be removed from the beginning.

    :auto-scroll? Whether the window should auto-scroll. This is the
          programmatic hook for the context menu entry.
