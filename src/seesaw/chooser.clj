(defn choose-file
  "Choose a file to open or save. The arguments can take two forms. First, with
  an initial parent component which will act as the parent of the dialog.

      (choose-file dialog-parent ... options ...)

  If the first arg is omitted, the desktop is used as the parent of the dialog:

      (choose-file ... options ...)

  Options can be one of:

    :type The dialog type: :open, :save, or a custom string placed on the Ok button.
          Defaults to :open.
    :dir  The initial working directory. If omitted, the previous directory chosen
          is remembered and used.
    :multi?  If true, multi-selection is enabled and a seq of files is returned.
    :filters A seq of lists where each list contains a filter name and a seq of
             extensions as strings for that filter. Default: [].
    :remember-directory? Flag specifying whether to remember the directory for future
                         file-input invocations in case of successful exit. Default: true.
    :success-fn  Function which will be called with the JFileChooser and the File which
                 has been selected by the user. Its result will be returned.
                 Default: return selected File. In the case of MULTI-SELECT? being true,
                 a seq of File instances will be passed instead of a single File.
    :cancel-fn   Function which will be called with the JFileChooser on user abort of the dialog.
                 Its result will be returned. Default: returns nil.

  Examples:

    ; ask & return single file
    (choose-file)

    ; ask & return including a filter for image files
    (choose-file :filters [[\"Images\" [\"png\" \"jpeg\"]]])

    ; ask & return absolute file path as string
    (choose-file :success-fn (fn [fc file] (.getAbsolutePath file)))

  Returns result of SUCCESS-FN (default: either java.io.File or seq of java.io.File iff multi? set to true)
  in case of the user selecting a file, or result of CANCEL-FN otherwise.
