  "Install a key mapping on a widget.

  Key mappings are hopelessly entwined with keyboard focus and the widget
  hierarchy. When a key is pressed in a widget with focus, each widget up
  the hierarchy gets a chance to handle it. There three 'scopes' with
  which a mapping may be registered:

    :self

      The mapping only handles key presses when the widget itself has
      the keyboard focus. Use this, for example, to install custom
      key mappings in a text box.

    :descendants

      The mapping handles key presses when the widget itself or any
      of its descendants has keyboard focus.

    :global

      The mapping handles key presses as long as the top-level window
      containing the widget is active. This is what's used for menu
      shortcuts and should be used for other app-wide mappings.

  Given this, each mapping is installed on a particular widget along
  with the desired keystroke and action to perform. The keystroke can
  be any valid argument to (seesaw.keystroke/keystroke). The action
  can be one of the following:

    * A javax.swing.Action. See (seesaw.core/action)
    * A single-argument function. An action will automatically be
      created around it.
    * A button, menu, menuitem, or other button-y thing. An action
      that programmatically clicks the button will be created.
    * nil to disable or remove a mapping

  target may be a widget, frame, or something convertible through to-widget.

  Returns a function that removes the key mapping.

  Examples:

    ; In frame f, key \"K\" clicks button b
    (map-key f \"K\" b)

    ; In text box t, map ctrl+enter to a function
    (map-key t \"control ENTER\"
      (fn [e] (alert e \"You pressed ctrl+enter!\")))
