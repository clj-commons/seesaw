(defprotocol Configurable
  "A protocol for configuring and querying properties of an object. Client
  code should use (seesaw.core/config!) and (seesaw.core/config) rather than
  calling protocol methods directly.
  
  See:
    (seesaw.core/config)
    (seesaw.core/config!)

(defn config
  "Retrieve the value of an option from target. For example:
  
    (config button1 :text)

  Target must satisfy the Configurable protocol. In general, it may be a widget, 
  or convertible to widget with (to-widget). For example, the target can be an event 
  object.

  Returns the option value. 
  Throws IllegalArgumentException if an unknown option is requested.

(defn config!
  "Applies options in the argument list to one or more targets. For example:

  Targets must satisfy the Configurable protocol. In general, they may be widgets,
