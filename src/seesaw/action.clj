(option-provider javax.swing.Action action-options)

(defn action
  "Construct a new Action object. Supports the following properties:

    :enabled?  Whether the action is enabled
    :selected? Whether the action is selected (for use with radio buttons,
               toggle buttons, etc.
    :name      The name of the action, i.e. the text that will be displayed
               in whatever widget it's associated with
    :command   The action command key. An arbitrary string identifier associated
               with the action.
    :tip       The action's tooltip
    :icon      The action's icon. See (seesaw.core/icon)
    :key       A keystroke associated with the action. See (seesaw.keystroke/keystroke).
    :mnemonic  The mnemonic for the button, either a character or a keycode.
                Usually allows the user to activate the button with alt-mnemonic.
                See (seesaw.util/to-mnemonic-keycode).
    :handler   A single-argument function that performs whatever operations are
               associated with the action. The argument is a ActionEvent instance.

  Instances of action can be passed to the :action option of most buttons, menu items,
  etc.

  Actions can be later configured with the same properties above with (seesaw.core/config!).

  Returns an instance of javax.swing.Action.
