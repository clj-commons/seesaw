  "ALPHA - EXPERIMENTAL AND GUARANTEED TO CHANGE

  Apply a stylesheet to a widget hierarchy. A stylesheet is simple a map where
  the keys are selectors and the values are maps from widget properties to
  values. For example,

    (apply-stylesheet frame {
      [:#foo]       { :text \"hi\" }
      [:.important] { :background :red } })

  Applying a stylesheet is a one-time operation. It does not set up any
  kind of monitoring. Thus, if you make a change to a widget that would
  affect the rules that apply to it (say, by changing its :class) you'll
  need to reapply the stylesheet.
