(def notes " This example shows the available Substance skins. Substance
is a set of improved look and feels for Swing. To use it in a project,
you'll need to add a dep to your Leiningen project:

        [com.github.insubstantial/substance \"7.1\"]

In this example, the full class name of the current skin is shown the
in the combobox above. For your own apps you could either use a
selector like this example, or, more likely, set a default initial
skin in one of the following ways:

    Start your VM with -Dswing.defaultlaf=<class-name>

    Call (javax.swing.UIManager/setLookAndFeel \"<class-name>\")
    do this *after* (seesaw.core/native!) since that sets the L&F.

See http://insubstantial.github.com/insubstantial/substance/docs/getting-started.html
for more info. There you'll also find much more info about the
skins along with much less crappy looking demos.")
