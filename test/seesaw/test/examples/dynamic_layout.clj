; Extremely basic example of a panel that changes what it shows based on
; whether it has enough room.
;
; Random thoughts:
;
; * Probably only works in a container like a grid where everything
;   get the same space. Otherwise modifying what's shown would trigger
;   a recursive layout cascade (probably?)
; * A card panel could be used to rather than :visible? to swap between
;   alternative layouts.
