; A very rudimentary example of (canvas).


; Define some paint handlers. Each takes the canvas and Graphics2D object
; as args. The function is called within a (seesaw.graphics/push) block
; so any changes made to the graphics context will be backed out when
; the function returns.
;

; This first handler uses raw Java2D calls to do painting. See (paint2) below
; for an example of using Seesaw's simple shape support.
